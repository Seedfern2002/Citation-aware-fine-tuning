Hamilton returned to the Bond film franchise with the chase- and heavily gadget-dependent \"Diamonds Are Forever\" (1971), \"Live and Let Die\" (1973) and \"The Man with the Golden Gun\" (1974). He claimed in a much later interview that he had instructed Roger Moore not to mimic Sean Connery's rendition of James Bond. Hamilton's only films in the latter part of the 1970s were the commercially unsuccessful \"Force 10 from Navarone\" (1978) and the poorly received adaptation of Agatha\n[2] Productions with Tony Richardson and John Osborne, and produced other acclaimed social realism dramas such as 1959's \"Look Back in Anger\" and 1960's \"Saturday Night and Sunday Morning\". Film director Anthony Mann noted the dichotomy in Saltzman's career: \"Harry used to make great pictures; now he makes very successful ones. After all, you can't be an artist all your life.\" In early 1961, excited by reading the James Bond novel \"Goldfinger\", he made a bid to land the film rights to the character.

He turned down an offer to direct \"Dr. No\" (1962), the first James Bond film. His next release, and somewhat outside his developing œuvre, was \"The Party's Over\", which, though filmed in 1963, was not released until 1965. The film was heavily censored and, in protest, Hamilton asked for his name to be removed when the film was finally released. Hamilton followed with his first James Bond film, \"Goldfinger\" (1964).

In 1970, Saltzman won control of the Technicolor Motion Picture Corporation from chairman Patrick Frawley\n[5] that saw him denied a percentage of the film's profits.

Schoenberg was also an influential teacher of composition; his students included Alban Berg, Anton Webern, Hanns Eisler, Egon Wellesz, Nikos Skalkottas, and later John Cage, Lou Harrison, Earl Kim, Roberto Gerhard, Leon Kirchner, Dika Newlin, and other prominent musicians. Many of Schoenberg's practices, including the formalization of compositional method and his habit of openly inviting audiences to think analytically, are echoed in avant-garde musical thought throughout the 20th century. His often polemical views of music\n[3] his various published textbooks demonstrate, was highly traditional and conservative. Schoenberg's textbooks also reveal that the Second Viennese School spawned not from the development of his serial method, but rather from the influence of his creative example. The principal members of the school, besides Schoenberg, were Alban Berg and Anton Webern, who were among his first composition pupils. Both of them had already produced copious and talented music in a late Romantic idiom but felt they gained new direction and discipline from Schoenberg's teaching. Other pupils of this generation included Ernst Krenek, Heinrich Jalowetz, Erwin Stein and Egon Wellesz, and\n[4] of early 20th-century music . Later, Schoenberg was to develop the most influential version of the dodecaphonic (also known as twelve-tone) method of composition, which in French and English was given the alternative name serialism by René Leibowitz and Humphrey Searle in 1947. This technique was taken up by many of his students, who constituted the so-called Second Viennese School. They included Anton Webern, Alban Berg and Hanns Eisler, all of whom were profoundly influenced by Schoenberg. He published a number of books, ranging from his famous \"Harmonielehre\" (Theory of Harmony) to \"Fundamentals of Musical Composition\" , many of which\n[5] side!\" Carr observes that Mahler could conceivably have lived to see \"his day\"; his near-contemporary Richard Strauss survived until 1949, while Sibelius, just five years younger than Mahler, lived until 1957.

The flag also has an official or semi-official status in some other Commonwealth realms: for example, it is a ceremonial flag in Canada by parliamentary resolution, and known there as the Royal Union Flag. Further, it is used as an official flag in some of the smaller British overseas territories. The Union Flag also appears in the canton (upper left-hand quarter) of the flags of several nations and territories that are former British possessions or dominions, as well as the state flag of Hawaii.\n[2] the Flags Act 1953, section 8 of that Act specified that \"this Act does not affect the right or privilege of a person to fly the Union Jack.\" The Union Jack continued to be used for a period thereafter as a national flag. The current national flag of New Zealand was given official standing under the New Zealand Ensign Act in 1902, but similarly to Australia the Union Jack continued to be used in some contexts as a national flag. On 5 February 2008, Conservative MP Andrew Rosindell introduced the 'Union Flag Bill' as a private member's bill under the\n[3] March. In this referendum, the country voted to keep the existing flag by 57% to 43%. The flag of New Zealand uses two prominent symbols: In its original usage as the flag of United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, the Union Jack combined three heraldic crosses which represent the countries of the United Kingdom (as constituted in 1801): The Union Jack reflects New Zealand's origins as a British colony. The Southern Cross constellation is one of the striking features of the Southern Hemisphere sky, and has been used to represent New Zealand, among other Southern Hemisphere colonies, since the\n[4] of the Union Flag, once the flag of the province. Along with the national flag, many other Australian flags retain the use of the Union Jack, including the Royal Australian Navy Ensign (also known as the Australian White Ensign), the Royal Australian Air Force Ensign, the Australian Red Ensign (for use by merchant and private vessels), and the Australian Civil Aviation Ensign. The flags of all six Australian States retain the Union Jack in the canton, as do some regional flags such as the Upper and Lower Murray River Flags. The Vice-Regal flags of the State Governors also use the\n[5] superior position but since it is reversed it does not precede the other flags. The coat of arms of the Chilean city of Coquimbo features the Union Jack, owing to its historical commercial links to Britain. The Union Flag can be found in the canton of several of the ensigns flown by vessels and aircraft of the United Kingdom and its overseas territories. These are used in cases where it is illegal to fly the Union Flag, such as at sea from a ship other than a British warship.

Most books written in English still use the term Chinook Jargon, but some linguists working with the preservation of a creolized form of the language used in Grand Ronde, Oregon prefer the term \"Chinuk Wawa\" (with the spelling 'Chinuk' instead of 'Chinook').

The Chinook writing, or Wawa shorthand, or Chinuk pipa, was developed by Father Jean-Marie-Raphaël Le Jeune in the early 1890s for writing in Chinook Jargon, Lillooet, Thompson, Okanagan, and English, with the intended purpose of bringing literacy and church teaching to the first nations in the Catholic Diocese of Kamloops. The result was three decades' publication of the Chinook Jargon language Kamloops Wawa. The Chinook writing is notable by the absence of affixes and word signs, the phonological rigor – vowels were not omitted, even when predictable – and its use of W-vowels.\n[3] from 1932 to the end of his life, he sent out a booklet about local history at Christmas, drawing both on research and his own personal memories (though also, doubtless, passing along some apocryphal stories). Some of these writings were later published in two volumes, \"Timepiece\" and \"The \"HB\" Story\". According to Nard Jones, Broderick was among the last Seattleites who could \"fully\" speak Chinook Jargon. The following is a partial bibliography of works by Broderick.

Priyadarshan was intrigued by its premise of a blind man witnessing a murder. After spending a month working on it, Priyadarshan told Mohanlal that they could fix the film and took two more months to draft a screenplay.

His directorial debut was the comedy film \"Bone\" starring Yaphet Kotto, a.k.a. \"Beverly Hills Nightmare\", \"Dial Rat for Terror\" and \"Housewife\". In 1974 he directed the horror film \"It's Alive\", about a mutant monster baby that embarks on a killing spree. The film – an initial commercial failure – was re-released with a new and sharper advertisement campaign; it went on to earn over $7 million for Warner Bros. and spawn two sequels. Cohen followed-up \"It's Alive\" with the science fiction-serial killer film \"God Told Me To\" (1976), in which a New York detective investigates a\n[2] spate of killings by apparently random people who say that God told them to commit the crimes. He would concentrate his work predominantly within the horror genre throughout the 1970s and 1980s, often incorporating elements of crime, police procedural, and science fiction with scathing social commentary. Cohen created the \"It's Alive\" series in 1974 when he made the film \"It's Alive\". The film was eventually a moderate success – after a re-vamped advertising campaign – and went on to spawn two sequels, \"It's Alive II: It Lives Again\" (1978) and \"It's Alive III: Island of the Alive\" (1987). \"It's Alive\"\n[3] states: 'It’s a terrible picture. It’s just beyond awful'. Cohen offered his 1974 script but remarks that it was completely ignored: \"I would advise anybody who likes my film to cross the street and avoid seeing the new enchilada.\" Critical response to Cohen's work has been extremely varied, reviews ranging from good to poor. Cohen's science fiction horror film and satirical social commentary \"The Stuff\" (1985) garnered mixed reviews, often being compared to Jack Finney's \"The Body Snatchers\" novel and the 1958 film \"The Blob\". It has a moderate \"fresh\" rating of 63% on Rotten Tomatoes. The \"Apollo Movie Guide\"\n[4] Again\" is on accepting one's child, even if it is born with deformities or disabilities. The score is again provided by Bernard Herrmann. The cast includes John P. Ryan, James Dixon, Andrew Duggan, and Frederic Forrest. During the 1980s, Cohen directed, produced, and scripted a number of low-budget horror films, many of which featured actor Michael Moriarty. The first was \"Q\" – a.k.a. \"Q: The Winged Serpent\" (1982) — about an Aztec god known as Quetzalcoatl (the Winged Serpent) resurrected and nesting atop the Chrysler Building.
