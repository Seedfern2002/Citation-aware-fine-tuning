Asperger’s Syndrome began to appear in the clinical literature around 1981 and it was added to the DSM in 1994 and subsequently removed in 2013 when the DSM-V (fifth edition) was published.

The explanations here are clear and useful, but perhaps the most helpful information is a sidebar that delineates the differences between autism, PDD, PDD-NOS, high-functioning autism and Asperger Syndrome. Diagnosis of these conditions seems more like an art than a science and the authors note that the primary distinction between AS and HFA lies within children's behavior before the age of three. Thus children with labels of AS and HFA will function similarly\n[3] orientation. It is also inherent as is gender and religious affiliation. Asperger’s Syndrome is a form of autism which is no longer officially recognized by the diagnostic index, but it should be. Instead, all formerly recognized forms of autism are lumped together under the title Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). In reality, there are vast differences between various types of autism. Asperger’s Syndrome has traditionally been called a high functioning form of autism. Those of us in the autistic rights movements are trying to reject the terms high and low functioning as those terms have their origins in the institutional setting\n[4] differences between high functioning autism and aspergers. People with both disabilities are identified to have difficulties in behavioral settings. For example, people with high-level autism and aspergers syndrome struggle with forming relationships and tend to not maintain eye contact when conversing with others. It is common for people with both autism and aspergers to experience difficulties with reading people’s facial expressions and hand gestures. Research has found that there are four areas in particular that distinguish the two: level of cognitive function, language development, motor skills, and aging.

It does come with practice if you keep at it. Another thing some singers do is listen with the headphones on one ear but pulled off the other one, so they can hear their voice through the ear they don't have covered up.\n[3] The headphone mix wasn’t right. I was so shy in the studio that I couldn’t hear what they were doing. I didn’t have the balls to say: I’m singing anymore until I can hear myself. I didn’t know to keep one part of the headphone on the ear and the other off the ear so that I could hear myself sing.

The vibration of the vocal chords and the piston pump-like action of the diaphragm causes the air to be pushed in and out of the vocal chords. This action produces the purring sound that is not unlike a musical hum. The vibration is strong enough so that anyone cuddling a purring cat would hear the sound and feel the vibration that occurs throughout its body. A purring cat can be likened to an idling engine. Scientists that have conducted studies on this unique ability of cats believe that purring is a voluntary act that\n[2] feature in a cat that makes it responsible for doing so. A good hypothesis obtained through electromyographic studies is that the purring noise is produced by cats due to the swift twitching of muscles in their larynx. When this occurs, the glottis rapidly dilates and constricts, leading to vibrations in the air when they are breathing in and out. Together with a cat’s steady breathing, a purring noise is produced. Cats purr as a way of communicating to other felines and humans. Since the purring sound happens when other ‘sociable’ signals have been made, many believe that the purr is\n[3] Jessie Gibb, of Ardgowan School, asks :- Why do cats purr, and how is the sound made? Christine Thomson, an anatomist at Massey University's Institute of Veterinary, Animal and Biomedical Sciences, responded. Domestic cats, cheetahs, pumas, ocelots and tigers purr, both when contented and at other times, including when they are sick, but not when they are asleep. Purring is due to bursts of sound occurring 25 times per second (40msec/sound), the frequency of sound in each burst is 150-200Hz. The sound bursts occur during inspiration and expiration with brief pauses at the change between the two phases of breathing.\n[4] loners and don’t compete with each other for meals, Hart says. Their communication doesn’t need to be far-reaching. For them, scent marking does the territorial trick (as some unfortunate cat owners quickly learn). The Purpose of Purring If roaring serves an evolutionary purpose, why do cats purr? We humans have long perceived purring as a simple sign of pleasure, in particular, contentment with our company. Although contentment does appear to produce purring, cats also purr when frightened or threatened. One way to think about this is to equate purring with smiling, says Kelly Morgan, DVM, clinical instructor at the Chicago\n[5] purrs after wondering why her own cat could be so annoying. In the study, recordings of 10 cats’ purrs revealed that cats sometimes develop a “twist on purring.” Cats add a vocalization into the mix to solicit responses from humans, Hart says. “Added to the basic 25 Hz purr is an overlay of a high-frequency cry-meow that humans perceive as somewhat obnoxious,” he says. “Cats apparently learn to do this to get people to feed them sooner.” This solicitation purr seems to develop more often in quiet households where cats have a one-on-one relationship with a human, and the purr\n[6] opening during the third phase allows airflow in or out of the trachea. This allows cats to breathe while they purr. Both the heart rate and respiratory rate increase during purring and the latter results in twice the amount of air being shifted during breathing. The diaphragm contracts alternatively with the laryngeal muscles, contributing to the changing air pressure and results in the purr which can be felt and usually heard. The frequency of the purr vibration is reported to be similar to sound frequencies that promote bone and muscle healing. This raises the possibility that purring when ill, aids\n[7] Debopriya Bose Sep 30, 2018 We have always been amused with a cat's ability to purr, and are curious to know why it does so. While some say that it is a means of communication, recent research shows that it has a healing effect as well. Purring is the vocal buzzing sound that we hear cats make when we pet them. But why and how do they do this? By experience, we can say that cats purr when they are happy. But they are also seen purring when stressed. Then what is the reason behind this? Like already mentioned, every\n[8] do cats purr and how is it connected to bone health? Most of us believe a purring cat is a happy cat. But it seems that purring can also be a sign of stress or injury, leading researchers to suspect that cats purr for self-healing. Examining further, researchers discovered cats may even be increasing their bone health through the constant low pressure vibrations that come with purring. It seems that purring frequencies are often right on target to improve bone density and possibly even fracture healing. During a “purr analysis” of frequency ranges done at the Cincinnati Zoo, the dominant\n[9] day two of their lives, making it a lifelong feature that tends to benefit them and their owners. When asking why do cats purr, it’s important to first understand how they purr. Whenever a cat is feeling good or bad emotionally or is in pain, the voice box begins to tighten and vibrate. The muscles of the voice box, known as the laryngeal muscles, create the purring sound when the cat inhales and exhales. Purring is a continuous sound that can last for several hours at a time, which makes it very relaxing to humans and cats. The level of\n[10] to us. Whatever the real answers behind the how and why of cat purring, there is one thing that we can be sure of. We like having cats around and we like it when they purr. Many people describe being down and depressed and having their pet cat come over to them and begin to purr, which causes them to relax and simply enjoy the company of their feline companion thus improving their mood. Also, with the beneficial effects the purring frequency actually has on bones and muscles, whether it is intentional or not, purring is pretty good for us"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It is believed that the muscles of the larynx start moving quickly which vibrates the vocal cords when the cat breathes, which causes the purring.

I wish to share this with my teenage children to refute the evolutionary theory they are taught at high school. Apes and humans and monkeys are all classified as primates, and are considered by evolutionary biologists to be very similar. Apes and humans are commonly claimed to be genetically between 95 and 99 percent the same, but if you compare them you will see some very important differences, even in their basic body structure which are listed below, first for Apes and\n[2] the Americas. Rain Forest Monkeys Monkeys are divided between New World monkeys (South and Central America) and Old World (African and Asian) monkeys. Most New World monkeys—squirrel monkeys, spider monkeys and capuchin monkeys, for instance—have “prehensile” tails which they use as a fifth arm or leg for wrapping around tree branches. Many Old World monkeys—the baboons and mandrills of Africa; the rhesus monkeys of India—are larger than New World monkeys. In fact, Old World monkeys are more closely related to apes than they are to their distant South and Central American cousins. Old World monkeys do not have prehensile tails;\n[3] University of Michigan’s Museum of Palaeontology. “Knowing the date is important because you can then look at what the conditions were like at that time and place and get some idea of what was driving their evolution,” he added [The Guardian]. But while it’s tempting to see ourselves in primate fossils, there’s no way to know whether Saadanius was actually an ancestor of humanity. It may have predated that split between old world monkeys and apes, but it could have been a branch on the evolutionary tree that died out.

The length of the spider monkey’s tail is about 59 cm. The tail is highly flexible and it doesn’t seem to have any hair at all. Spider monkeys usually live in trees but they do come to the ground. While walking, their long tail drags on the surface. They use tail to maintain balance not only in walking but also while moving through the trees. What do Spider Monkeys Eat? They are frugivores.

Tailed monkeys are nearer to the rodents, and at the same time to the other animals, while the apes exemplify rather more those characteristics already enumerated for the whole group.

In the tumultuous 1960s, writers Michael Wilson and Rod Serling recognized the potential for a civil-rights parable in which a white patriarch (Charlton Heston) finds out what it is like to be the subjugated race.

The invention\n[2] use of mainframe computers. In 1965, the mainframe computer truly came into its own with the introduction of the IBM 360 series. The 360 was the first commercial computer with a power- ful operating system that could provide time sharing, multitasking, and virtual memory in more advanced models. IBM has dominated mainframe computing from this point on. Mainframe computers became powerful enough to support thousands of online remote terminals connected to the centralized mainframe using proprietary communication protocols and proprietary data lines.

Where I do disagree with many in the mainframe space is that mainframe computing will continue to be a platform for new applications.

If we subtract the observed mass from the total gravitational mass, what we have is a different kind of mass. A dark, unseen kind known as dark matter. In the figure I’ve plotted a comparison of the the amount of regular visible matter vs the amount of dark matter in our galaxy. We’re not yet sure what dark matter is, though we have some ideas. What we do know is\n[7] around us and convinces us that we are still not good enough. What can we do when these superficial comparisons come up? What do we do when being “not good enough” overrules our thoughts? The truth of the matter is we aren’t good enough. This may not seem reassuring at first, but it is an important element of the gospel. We were once separated from Christ and were children of darkness, allowing fleshly desires and pursuits to rule us. We aren’t good enough because our own deeds, no matter how “good” they may seem, were considered filthy rags (Isaiah 64:6).\n[8] But it gets worse. We really have no clue what dark matter and energy are, or how they work. We are pretty sure they exist though. So, what DO we know? Dark matter is the stuff that makes it possible for galaxies to exist. When we calculated why the universe is structured the way it is, it quickly became clear that there is just not enough ‘normal’ matter—the gravity of the visible matter is not strong enough to form galaxies and complex structures. Stars would more likely be scattered all over the place and not form galaxies. So we know\n[9] it is not widely thought that the dark matter is neutrinos. We think we have a good idea how many neutrinos there ought to be, and it isn't enough. When we talk about the observation of gravitational lensing--how are we accounting for the incredible diversity of gravitational effects that could be involved in between our vantage point vs. what the actual state of the observed position? That's the job of astronomers, to bring to bear everything they can and try to think of all possibilities, and still come up with a best interpretation of what they are seeing.

In India, Korea, Vietnam, and the Philippines, lower teeth are thrown upward but teeth from the upper jaw are thrown to the floor, to encourage the new adult teeth to grow straight.

The idea that one butterfly could eventually have a far-reaching ripple effect on subsequent historic events seems first to have appeared in a 1952 short story by Ray\n[9] The term Butterfly effect is a concept invented by the American meteorologist, Edward Lorenz to highlight the possibility of small changes causing momentous effects; in simple term it was used in chaos theory to describe how small changes to unrelated thing or conditions could affect large complex systems.

The paradox suggest that Olympus Mons isn't a volcano at all, but is merely a mound of debris caused by an electric stress explosion of a large meteorite on a collision course with Mars. An approaching meteorite, which typically carries a strong electric charge, would 'see' a substantial electric field extending from Mars into space. Long before an asteroid or comet would impact, the extending electric field would carry with it an electric discharge-current that would shock-fracture an incoming meteorite into a cloud of sand,\n[7] to plate tectonics, and the most of the world’s volcanoes are located near plate boundaries where subduction is happening. This is where one plate is passing under another plate, sinking into the Earth’s mantle. The largest shield volcano in the Solar System is Olympus Mons on Mars. This monster measures 27 km above the surface of Mars, and is 550 km in width. It’s believed that Olympus Mons got so big because Mars lacks plate tectonics.

Olympus Mons is the youngest of the large volcanoes on Mars, having formed during Mars' Amazonian Period. Olympus Mons is the result of many thousands of highly fluid, basaltic lava flows that poured from volcanic vents over a long period of time. The extraordinary size of Olympus Mons is likely because Mars lacks mobile tectonic plates. Unlike on Earth, the crust of Mars remains fixed over a stationary hotspot, and a volcano can continue to discharge lava until it reaches an enormous height.

Clicker training is one of the leading methods of dog training, and with its rewards-based workings accompanied by a little classical conditioning, it’s not very hard to see why. But while a lot of dog trainers sing praises for this training method, there are still some who opt not to use it or those who claim that it does not work for them.

We suggest that you use the methods that are best suited for your dog,\n[5] if he chooses, but that’s about it. He doesn’t need to have an intimate relationship with it. Don’t click the clicker when you are not training your dog. Don’t click it unless you are trying to make note of a good behavior. If you click for the heck of it, or to show your dog what it does, you will confuse the dog. For those reasons, we suggest carrying the clicker only when you plan to do your clicker training and to keep the clicker away from the kids or others who might play with it.

The clicker way of training, as opposed to the other show dog training methods, uses a simple toy-like feature called the ‘clicker’ that makes a distinctive sound upon each click.

Members of the Rastafari movement are known as Rastas, or Rastafari. The movement is sometimes referred to as “Rastafarianism,” but this term is considered derogatory and offensive by some Rastas, who dislike being labelled as an “ism.”[3] The Rastafari movement encompasses themes such as the spiritual use of cannabis[4][5] and the rejection of western\n[5] includes a chapter entitled, “The Ras Tafari Movement” on pp. 208-223.

When the 1960s came to a close, the message and spirit of Rastafari had spread all across the world through reggae music (Dijk 1998, 181). “By the end of the sixties, the influence of the Rastafarian movement on the development of the popular culture was evident by the fact that the most serious reggae artists adhered to some of the principals of the Rastafarian movement” (Campbell 1987, 154). Musicians like Bob Marley and Burning Spear forced people to hear the words of Rastafari by making their struggle and history the main themes in the music.\n[10] Rastafari, also known as Rastafarianism, is an Abrahamic religion that developed in Jamaica during the 1930s.

When bonds are broken, for example in decomposition, energy is absorbed from the surroundings in order to break the bond.

In an EXOTHERMIC reaction, the amount of energy needed to break the necessary bonds in the reactants is LESS than the amount of heat energy released when the bonds in the products are made. In an ENDOTHERMIC reaction, the amount of energy needed to break the necessary bonds in the reactants is MORE than the amount of energy released when the bonds in the products\n[7] atoms, ions, and molecules that are necessary if their old bonds are to break and new ones to form. All molecules store potential energy, which is released when their bonds are broken. Four forms of energy essential to human functioning are: chemical energy, which is stored and released as chemical bonds are formed and broken; mechanical energy, which directly powers physical activity; radiant energy, emitted as waves such as in sunlight; and electrical energy, the power of moving electrons. Chemical reactions begin with reactants and end with products. Synthesis reactions bond reactants together, a process that requires energy, whereas decomposition\n[8] start the reaction. Forming bonds releases energy to the surroundings (raises temperature). Breaking bonds requires input energy from the surroundings (lowers temp). The stronger the bond, the more energy required to break it, or, the more energy is released when it is formed. Strong bonds means low energy state means stable molecule; but weak bonds means high energy state and less stable. Generally, forming lower-energy, more stable molecules is favored.

But how much do we actually know about them? Apparently there are as many as 17 different types of pearls and these fall into three main categories – natural, cultured and imitation. Natural pearls are very rare these days due to over harvesting in the past. For them to be formed requires a unique set of circumstances. They are formed inside molluscs, moist commonly oysters and mussels. The process begins when an irritant gets inside\n[3] a very small group of lucky people, i.e. royalty. Pearls were so rare because we didn’t know how to farm them and only one in a thousand oysters found in the wild would contain a pearl of gem quality. Therefore, it would take around 50,000 oysters to make a necklace. Before the 1890s, when we learned how to grow pearls, all pearls were what we now call natural, which means that they were found in an oyster picked from the wild. Natural pearls are those that are formed when an intruder (such as a bit of coral for example) randomly\n[4] to coat it in nacre. This build-up of nacre creates a stunning, lustrous pearl. Because natural pearls are so rare, cultured and freshwater pearls are produced and used in jewellery making. Oysters are used to create cultured pearls by placing a stimulant such as flesh from another oyster or a bead which causes the oyster to produce the pearl sac and coat it with nacre. Similarly freshwater pearls are made in the same process but using freshwater mussels instead of oysters. Pearl is a timeless classic that has been loved by women all over the world for centuries.

The word pearl has become a metaphor for something very rare, fine, admirable, and valuable. In many ways we are like a pearl in God’s hands that\n[6] beginning. Natural Vs. Cultured Pearls Natural pearls and cultured pearls are created in different ways. Natural pearls occur in the wild, without any human assistance. They are hunted and are quite rare. When found, the pearls are harvested, cleaned and made into jewelry. Cultured pearls, on the other hand, are grown under tightly controlled conditions by pearl farmers. Farmers plant a core made up of mussel shell into an oyster or mussel; then the oyster or mussel forms a pearl around this irritant, just as they do when forming natural pearls. Pearl farmers design cultured pearls from start to finish,\n[7] pearls. However, the formation of pearls is so rare that a natural pearl forms in only one in every 2,000 oyster shells. In some cases, one in 50,000 shells for some of the rarer colored pearls, making them rarer then many precious gems. Irregardless, Hollywood female stars have always favored pearls.

By contrast, cultured pearls are human creations. They are formed by artificially inserting a tissue graft from a donor oyster, which then triggers the recipient oyster’s natural defences, effectively replicating the natural process. In 1916, Japanese biologist Tokichi Nishikawa was granted the patent for cultured pearls, and a dozen years later, the first commercial crop was successfully produced, changing the industry forever.

Benchmarking against the\n[3] best case scenario, the terminated employee will understand why they were terminated and continue to maintain positive feeling toward your company in the future. You can encourage this by calmly articulating the reasons for their dismissal and suggesting a course of action for them as they look for a new job.

Does a person develop OCD because their brain is damaged? If so then drug treatment or brain surgery is a viable option.

Unless it is caught early, herniation eventually results in coma and death. When possible, brain tumors are removed through surgery. While many can be removed with little or no damage to the brain, others are located where surgical removal is difficult or impossible without destroying critical parts of the brain. Brain damage caused by surgery can lead to partial paralysis, changes in sensation (feeling), weakness and poor thinking. Even so, removing a tumor is necessary when it threatens important brain structures. Even when it can't cure a malignancy, surgery can help reduce the size of\n[4] hypoxia or hypoxic brain injury). Consequently, a patient in this situation can suffer brain damage as well as other injuries. Failure to monitor blood flow to the brain During surgery, the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the brain needs to continue so that the brain cells will live. This is one of an anesthesiologist’s main jobs during surgery. When an anesthesiologist is negligent, it is possible for a patient to lose blood fluid during surgery, which leads to a loss of blood flow to the brain. As a result, the patient could suffer strokes to both side of the brain—leading\n[5] injury in the United States is motor vehicle accidents. Sudden Impact Causes Brain Damage The most recognized cause of a head injury resulting from an accident is the skull's sudden, if not immediate deceleration as a result of striking a blunt object such as a steering wheel, dashboard or even air bag. When the skull’s momentum is stopped, the brain’s momentum within the skull does not automatically stop at the same time. The brain can be compared with a piece of jello within a container. While the container may stop, the jello within carries the momentum and squishes against the\n[6] How are brain bleeds (intracranial hemorrhages) treated? Treatment of intracranial hemorrhages (brain bleeds) depends on the type and severity of the injury. Because brain bleeds often result in permanent brain damage, treatment of intracranial hemorrhages is often supportive and therapeutic in nature. However, surgery may be necessary to manage certain intracranial hemorrhages, such as subdural hematomas. If an infection is present due to a brain bleed like a cephalohematoma (cephalhematoma), antibiotics are used. In order to promptly begin treatment, it is critical that medical professionals diagnose intracranial hemorrhages as soon as possible.

Accidents, falls, sports injuries and assaults are common causes of traumatic brain injury. Severe brain injuries require intensive care and life-saving surgery, followed by intense rehabilitation to relearn and recover your skills. A suboccipital craniotomy is a surgery to remove a medium or large acoustic neuroma that's causing problems. A section of your skull behind the ear is removed to access the tumor and nerves. This surgery helps maintain facial nerve function, preserves your hearing and removes the tumor. Clipping is a\n[8] the brain. When these stickers are in the wrong place or they aren’t used and no other markings are made prior to surgery, it is possible for a neurosurgeon to accidentally cut into a healthy part of the brain rather than a brain tumor or blood clot. Consequently, any time the brain is damaged there is a chance a person can suffer emotional issues, communication challenges, physical impairments, and memory loss that can last a lifetime. Although many factors can lead neurologists to make mistakes during surgery, ultimately negligence is the cause. When an error made during surgery leads to\n[9] deprivation during childbirth and medical conditions can also result in brain injuries. No matter how a brain injury occurs, the patient will likely need emergency treatment and possibly surgery and a lengthy hospital stay. He or she may also need extensive rehabilitation as an inpatient and/or outpatient. It is not uncommon for patients with severe brain injuries to have to relearn how to feed themselves, talk, walk, sign their names or perform other tasks that they had performed automatically prior to their injury. In some cases, a brain injury can be so severe that the patient will require medical care\n[10] (a stroke for example) or through a traumatic injury. Alternatively, parts of the brain survive but function abnormally due to brain damage. It is well known that brain damage sometimes does affect the thought process.[6] The exact effect depends on which parts of the brain are damaged and in what manner the damage occurred.

What do we see?\n\nDocuments:\n[1] Chapter 2 – Basic Theory – Electromagnetic Spectrum – Color is reflected light Color is reflected light When we see color, we are actually looking at reflected light. When illuminating an object or scene, a light source emits a spectrum of colored wavelengths. For example, sunlight emits a spectrum including infrared, ultraviolet and all visible wavelengths, whereas candlelight emits only red, orange, yellow and infrared wavelengths, giving everything it illuminates an orange cast. When a scene or object is illuminated, some of the light source’s wavelengths are absorbed and some are reflected.

Practically speaking, the difference between the two (Doppler redshift and cosmological redshift) is this: in the case of a Doppler shift, the only thing that matters is the relative velocity of the emitting object when the light is emitted compared to that of the receiving object when the light is received. After the light is emitted, it doesn't matter what happens to the emitting object - it won't affect the wavelength of the light that\n[3] colours we see in the world. Human beings don’t see wavelengths of light, but they do see the spectral colours that correspond with each wavelength and colours produced when different wavelengths are combined. The visible spectrum includes all the spectral colours between red and violet and each is produced by a single wavelength. The visible spectrum is often divided into named colours, though any division of this kind is somewhat arbitrary. Traditional colours referred to in English include red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet.

Doppler thought that his effect might explain the different colors of stars. The light from stars that happen to be moving away from the earth would be shifted toward longer wavelengths, and since red light has a wavelength longer than the average wavelength for visible light, such a star might appear redder than average. Similarly, light from stars that happen to be moving toward the earth would be shifted toward shorter wavelengths, so the star might appear unusually blue. It was soon pointed out by Buys-Ballot and others that the Doppler effect\n[5] use the Doppler effect to measure speed. The behavior of light or radio waves is similar. Indeed, the police make use of the Doppler effect to measure the speed of cars by measuring the wavelength of pulses of radio waves reflected off them. As we noted in Chapter 5, the wavelength of visible light is extremely small, ranging from forty- to eighty-millionths of a centimeter. The different wavelengths of light are what the human eye sees as different colors, with the longest wavelengths appearing at the red end of the spectrum and the shortest wavelengths at the blue end.

The light we can see is constrained within the visible electromagnetic spectrum, i.e. between 400 and 700 nm. Each wavelength in this spectrum is related to a distinct colour and has distinct effects. Beyond the visible spectrum, we have infrared light, which has a wavelength of more than 700 nm. Infrared light is not visible. Shorter wavelengths have a superficial impact on the skin, whereas longer wavelengths penetrate deeper into the skin. Light and\n[7] physics, a red shift is when light or other electromagnetic radiation from an object has a wavelength that is stretched to the point that its light is shifted to the red end of the light spectrum. In fact, regardless of whether or not the light or radiation is in the visible spectrum, “redder” means an increase in wavelength -- equivalent to a lower frequency and lower photon energy, in accordance with, correspondingly, the wave and quantum theories of luminosity. The galactic red shifts are an example of The Doppler Effect. The Doppler Effect is a change in frequency or wavelength\n[8] longest visible wavelengths and visible photons of the lowest energy. Therefore we say that the light is redder and cooler. If the star happens to be moving toward the observer, the wave crests are closer together. The light is bluer and warmer. ​The amount of change in wavelength, divided by the wavelength, is called the Doppler shift. The Doppler shift is positive if the star is moving away from the observer. In the same situation the distance between the star and the observer is expanding, the light is redder, and the light is cooler. All of these are different ways\n[9] source that won’t dry out your skin. Blue light works because of its frequency, and red light works because of its wavelength. Wavelength on the visual spectrum determines the color of the light you see. Blue, for example has a relatively low wavelength, approximately 450 nanometers. Red has a high wavelength, around 700 nanometers, and it is the last visible color before invisible infrared light. Although we can’t see infrared, we can feel it in the form of heat. We can see the visible spectrum of light when white light gets distorted in bubbles. You may have heard that tanning\n[10] is blue light and the effects on the human body. Before we dive into that, let’s take a little crash course through basic physics and human physiology. The visible light spectrum is exactly what it sounds like: all the light we see. The spectrum breaks apart by energy properties, or wavelengths, which our eyes and brain interpret as color. Remember Roy G. Biv? Moving from “warm colors” (red, orange, and yellow) into cool colors (blue, indigo, and violet) the wavelength shortens, translating into more energy.

Wading through all the popular conclusions and other factors that do not explain why incarceration has gone up so rapidly, their research pointed to political choices. The bottom line for Stoll and Raphael is that since the 1980s, this increase is “attributable to changes in sentencing policy,” which has resulted in longer sentences,\n[3] with the police and the prosecutors in every instance, to “get tough on crime”—have become, at the very least, negotiable.

You can conclude that there is not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis. Or that your model was incorrectly specified. Consider the exact equation y = x2. A regression of y against x (for -a < x < a) will\n[8] and the other variable, placed on the y-axis, is assumed to be the dependent variable (i.e., dependent on the x variable). We use a straight line or a linear curve when we fit a line to the data scatter plot. The straight line is the reason for the word linear in the name “simple linear”. This equation that describes the relationship between the x and y variables is what we call the regression equation or the regression model. Simple linear regression is the analysis of the relationship between variables using the Least Squares Method with two constraints or limitations: 1)\n[9] dataset and those predicted by the linear function. So, what is non-linear regression exactly? First, non-linear regression is a method to model a non-linear relationship between the dependent variable and a set of independent variables. Second, for a model to be considered non-linear, Y hat must be a non-linear function of the parameters Theta, not necessarily the features X. When it comes to non-linear equation, it can be the shape of exponential, logarithmic, and logistic, or many other types. As you can see in all of these equations, the change of Y hat depends on changes in the parameters Theta,\n[10] that were obtained using a linear regression (the method will be described below): As a plot: The equation that is used to calculate linear regression is as follows (from wikipedia): Alright, so what does that mean?

There, part of it flows to the horseshoe-shaped Canadian Falls (aptly named Horseshoe Falls), and the rest flows to the American Falls. At the American falls, the river is also split by a second small island, Luna Island, creating the third, small waterfall known as Bridal Veil Falls. The vertical drop to the water at the bottom, in the Maid of the Mist pool, varies depending upon how much water is being diverted to the hydroelectric facility upstream of the Falls. The American Falls is slightly higher than the Horseshoe Falls but has much less water going over it.\n[6] order to channel water across the city of Niagara Falls to a small reservoir near the edge of the Niagara gorge. This reservoir provided a continuous flow of water to the Schoellkopf power plant in order to provide efficient hydroelectric power to the city. The Schoellkopf power plant was built into the edge of the Niagara gorge, resting 200 feet over the bottom, and roughly 2000 feet down river from the Niagara Falls.

To support a better progress of this framework and to ensure that it prospers for the betterment of the society, a self governed legal profession and a proactive civil society are extremely important.

Why is organic so much more expensive than non-organic? Why is junk food so much more expensive than the better quality stuff? Why is fish, so full of Omega 3 and other things so expensive?

While these complications are uncommon, they do sometimes occur and must be considered prior to giving consent to the procedure. • Any time a needle is used there is a risk of infection. However, we are using new, disposable and sterile needles, and infections are extremely rare. • A needle may be placed inadvertently in an artery or vein. If an artery or vein is punctured with the needle, a hematoma (or bruise) will develop. • If a nerve is touched, it may cause paresthesia (a prickling sensation) which is usually brief, but it\n[2] scars, which may be mistaken for signs of abuse. For example, acupuncture is sometimes combined with moxibustion (i.e., smoldering herbs attached to an acupuncture needle or placed directly on the skin), which may cause scars resembling cigarette burns. Other Asian therapies, such as cupping (Figure 1) and coining (Figure 2), may leave bruises.16 Mongolian spots, common in Asian, Latino, and black infants, also resemble bruises and may be mistaken for signs of abuse.17 During cupping, heated glass jars are applied to the patient’s skin. As the jars cool, suction draws the skin inward, causing localized redness and bruising. This technique\n[3] they rigid like a needle that could be used to sew together two pieces of material. Instead, they flex and are too fine to puncture the thick walls of an artery. It is very rare to bleed from an acupuncture needle. Only very rarely might bruising be caused from hitting a capillary. Each needle is sterile and sealed in an individual blister packaging until the time of needling. Needles are disposed of in a bio-hazardous container after each and every treatment, never to be used again. Acupuncture has been recognized by both the World Health Organization and the National Institutes\n[4] treating specific problems within their scope of practice. This can mean that there use of needles is slightly more hard-hitting than, say, a traditional acupuncturist who is trying to move energy. Trying to get a neuro-physiological effect can sometimes mean using thicker needles and deeper insertions, and with that the risk of a bruise or a slight nerve impingement increases considerably. This does not usually mean permanent damage; even when people do suffer treatment injuries very few indeed cause more than a short lived problem. It does mean, though, that there can be a very different kind of post treatment\n[5] not be painful and the feeling of discomfort should be at a minimum. Negative side effects of acupuncture can sometimes be slight bruising at the site of needling. This often fades in a few days. Acupuncturists are very careful not to cause a bruise.

Sometimes only rubbing one’s eye can cause a bruise. However additional cuts or bruises may be a real cause for concern. It’s best to stay on top of the situation, so be sure to do the following: Discuss each instance with the caregivers. Put them on notice that you’re concerned and that you’re involved. Keep a journal of the incident and any incidents that follow. Note the date and time and the response of the caregivers to your inquiries. Ask your loved one if he or she\n[7] license; an unlicensed practitioner may use suboptimal technique that causes bruising. Those experiencing severe bruising from acupuncture may derive benefit from application of an ice pack immediately after bruise formation. Nevertheless, if you bruise easily from acupuncture with needles, you may want to consider testing alternative non-needle formats involving electrical pulses and/or lasers. Assuming you take a break from acupuncture as soon as bruises are noticed, your body will metabolize the blood cells and the bruise will eventually fade in color and disappear. Death: Though uncommon, a small percentage of individuals receiving acupuncture end up dying. In a 2010 publication\n[8] breakage, rare as it was even then, was when needles were autoclaved to sterilise them for re-use. Modern needles are used once only and then disposed of, so the constant heating and cooling which made the steel brittle does not happen. The most likely cause of your discomfort is that there has been some bruising beneath the skin surface which has caused a hard clot to form and which impinges a nerve when you move in certain ways.

Depending on the presence of electricity grid, the PV systems could be categorized into on-grid and off-grid systems. Grid connected systems are electrically connected to the electricity grid and the energy produced is utilized for energy-electricity savings. The off-grid systems are employed in areas with no access to the grid and the energy produced covers the overall electricity demand of the loads connected to them.\n[8] Home Off Grid Taking yourself off the national power grid What Is \"Off Grid\"? Off grid is a term to describe not being connected to the main or national electrical grid, thereby using a stand-alone power system. It requires a renewable energy system that is not connected to the electricity grid (a stand-alone system) in order to power your home or business. “It makes economic sense and appeals to your environmental values.” Until recently a stand-alone, off-grid solar installation big enough to provide all the power requirements for a remote game lodge or camp was unheard of.

A VPN provides anonymity and privacy for every desktop and mobile device that accesses the Internet. VPNs use so-called \"tunneling\" protocols because they tunnel a private channel through a public network (see VPN protocols). VPNs provide a server that sits between the user and the destination website, which only sees the IP address of the VPN and not the user (see illustration below). See VPN service, anonymous Web surfing and proxy server. A VPN encrypts the user's data\n[4] Unfortunately as they say \"there's no such thing as a free ride\". It's important to understand that free proxies are never safe or secure. Proxies by their very nature or not secure and provide no real anonymity. It is much easier than people realize to track someone using a proxy, in many cases proxies make it easier to identify someone. Instead of using a free proxy which is not secure, you should consider the use of a VPN account. A VPN account will make your entire internet connection for all programs secure and anonymous.

One of the main benefits of a VPN is that it cloaks all of your web traffic, whether it is browsing, streaming, downloading or uploading. In contrast, a proxy only works through your web browser. Browsing through a proxy server can enhance your security and anonymity, as well as helping you to get around any site restrictions in schools or workplaces. A proxy server sits between your computer and the rest of the internet, disguising the nature of your traffic. One of the main benefits of a proxy over a VPN is that they aren't as resource heavy,\n[9] anonymity networks The next easy step is to anonymize yourself further is to hop onto an anonymity relay network. The strongest and most popular of these networks is the Tor Network, but paid Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) can provide privacy at a higher speed. An anonymity network, proxy network, or VPN encrypts all data between a home network and a server located somewhere else. As long as you can trust the proxy provider more than you can trust your Internet Service Provider, these anonymity networks are an excellent way to make spying and censorship on your local network even harder.\n[10] similar to that of a proxy server and if you are familiar with how a proxy works, then you will be able to easily see the advantages of using a VPN server to be anonymous online. Virtual private networks make you anonymous because they give you a new IP.

In the case of the incomplete or flickering fusion events, only small amounts of neurotransmitter would be released for every opening of the fusion pore, thus producing submaximal activation of postsynaptic receptors.

The flicker fusion threshold is the speed at which a series if static images appear to become a steady moving image or when a flashing light flashes on and off quickly enough that we see a steady beam (flourescent lights).

CFF determines the highest frequency of a flickering light stimulus, or the corresponding minimum inter-event interval, which allows to distinguish subsequent light impulses as separate events. Frequencies of flicker above that value cause the impulses to be fused and perceived as a continuous stimulus. The exact value of fusion frequency depends on multiple factors, e.g., light wavelength or intensity or background lighting conditions, with the CFF usually specifying the highest threshold value found in any condition, representative for a particular species (Umeton et al., 2017).

A critical part of understanding these visual perception phenomena is that the eye is not a camera, i.e.: there is no \"frame rate\" or \"scan rate\" in the eye. Instead, the eye/brain system has a combination of motion detectors, detail detectors and pattern detectors, the outputs of all of which are combined to create the visual experience.

The biggest weakness of encryption algorithms is the fact that some algorithms fail to generate seemingly random strings of ciphertext, but instead generate recognizable patterns. For example, when a hacker is able to identify a pattern,\n[4] protocol Any type of web browser supports this protocol. • How does the SSL protocol work? The SSL protocol works simply by encrypting the data that you send using the RSA coding system. Your browser collaborates with the secure server and encrypts the data, so that if any individual manages to get hold of them during the transmission process, they will not be able to read them as they will not have the required code. • What is a security certificate? A security certificate is awarded by a certifying entity: the Certification Authority. This entity awards this certificate after having\n[5] encrypt a message. Then, only that person's private key can decrypt that message. One disadvantage of public-key encryption is that is is slower than other methods, such as secret-key encryption. In secret-key encryption, a single key provides that only way to encrypt and decrypt, simplifying and speeding up the process. In public-key encryption, the encryption and decryption processes have to work with two different keys, each related to each other by a complex mathematical process involving prime number factorization. Thus, encryption and decryption take more time and computer resources. Public-key encryption also does not have a built-in method for authentication.\n[6] knowing the encryption key. This is considered a basic, necessary property for a working encryption system. The process of converting ciphertext to plaintext. The process of converting plaintext to ciphertext. Secret data is encoded with a function using this key. Sometimes multiple keys are used. These must be kept secret, if a key is exposed to an attacker, any data encrypted with it will be exposed.

A nonce is often\n[7] any journalists encrypting data although they had some basic knowledge of encryption. Their reluctance to encrypt is usually due to a lack of understanding about what encryption actually is and how it works. And none of their employers are encouraging the practice. It’s seems unlikely that Indonesian journalists will incorporate data encryption practices into their everyday working habits, anytime soon. In the Philippines, we found some journalists using data encryption tools. However, they didn’t do it consistently and these processes were not integrated into their working practices.

Mining is the process of confirming a transaction and adding it to a general ledger. To add transactions to the ledger, “miners” must solve computational problems that are increasingly complicated (such as mathematical puzzles).

Email encryption renders messages and connection unreadable to the hackers. What is Encrypted Email: How Does It Work? When it comes to information protection, one of the most effective methods involves the process of email encryption. There are different technology tools that can be used to encrypt an email. One popular method of information protection is through a personal email certificate. This method works by digitally signing your messages. A\n[10] or 256 bits in length. A less-popular and occasionally-used method is the “stream method.” This method applies to plaintext digits that are combined with a pseudorandom cipher digit stream - or “keystream.” The algorithm applies to each binary digit in a data stream, one bit per input. How Does the Encryption Work & What Is the Role of the Key? The encryption/decryption key is comparable with a normal password - the one you use for your email, for example.

Very simply, a scout bee has a number of specialised functions, one of which is scouting for flower nectar. She heads off in search of nectar and comes back to tell the other bees.

Regardless of whether this dance results in worker bees visiting the indicated site or not, the waggle dance remains an important aspect of the way bees communicate as it ‘inspires’ them to look for food.

Insects, like bees, have hive mentalities, but most of their communication is based on external signals. In communicating the source of honey, scientists theorize that scout bees perform a \"waggle dance\" to alert other bees to their discoveries. Some scientists say the dance tells all the information that is needed, but others say the dance is just a kind of wake-up call to an odor plume, a trail of pollen aroma that can lead the bees to the flowers bearing the pollen. This is hive mentality, but it is based on external communication. Someone who has\n[6] of communication known to nature, or at least I think so. Using an intricate set of dance steps bees returning from foraging or hive site exploration describe to other bees in the hive the location and quality of these sites. The hive “votes” on the most viable site by the number of bees joining in the dance and the intensity of the dancing itself. In the case of selecting a new hive site, the bees will only relocate when a unanimous decision has been reached. My favorite resource on the waggle dance is Thomas Seeley’s Honeybee Democracy. It’s a bit\n[7] on the “bees algorithm,” which describes how bees find the best route to flowers. Scout bees fly long distances in random directions, and if they find food, they fly back and buzz around in the so-called “waggle dance” to notify everyone else.

I have a whole page explaining the plant pollination process. However, to describe briefly here, bees pollinate by carrying pollen on their bodies from the male part (the ‘stamen’) of one flower to the female part (the ‘carpel’) of another flower. There is a wide range of books about pollination available, with lots of details. Do Bees Other Than Honey Bees Pollinate? Some different types of bees are more efficient than others for pollinating particular plants. If\n[9] the other bees died in the hive, the queen bee could start another colony.

As the effects of alcohol wear off, the good feelings and higher levels of dopamine dissipate. Over time, the repetition of drinking alcohol alters the normal dopamine levels in the brain, resulting in the expectancy of the presence of alcohol and higher dopamine levels. As a result, the brain will discontinue its production of the levels of dopamine that were previously present without alcohol.

Prolactin levels are typically kept in check by the neurotransmitter dopamine, a substance produced in the brain by the hypothalamus. Decreased dopamine levels, due to a disease of the hypothalamus or a dopamine-blocking drug, may lead to increased levels of prolactin. Many other drugs can raise prolactin levels. High-dose estrogen can raise blood prolactin levels. People with an underactive thyroid (Hypothyroidism) may have elevated levels of prolactin. Chronic kidney failure or cirrhosis (Cirrhosis) may be associated with hyperprolactinemia. Moreover, increased levels of prolactin in the blood decrease\n[4] for a long time. Scientifically speaking, alcohol withdrawal happens because of increased dopamine and serotonin levels in the brain. Dopamine and serotonin are two chemicals that the brain normally produces on its own. Alcohol causes surges in these levels. Eventually, the brain no longer produces them. When alcohol consumption is stopped abruptly, it can come as quite a shock to the body. This is when withdrawal begins. With proper treatment withdrawal symptoms can be addressed and significantly decreased. Over time, alcohol withdrawal will subside.

Low dopamine levels induced by a shortage of thiamin in the diet were linked to this abnormal animal behavior.[v] In 1988, researchers noted a thiamin-deficient diet decreased dopamine concentration and synthesis in the brain (striatum). The provision of alcohol to lab animals also decreased dopamine levels. The brain region most susceptible to damage (the hypothalamus) in thiamin-deficient animals is the very same region of the brain that produces dopamine.[vi] In 1999, it was observed that low levels of thiamin in the cerebrospinal fluid were related to Parkinson’s disease.[vii] In 2013,\n[7] The brain plays a role in tolerance due to the actions of neurotransmitter systems such as glutamate and dopamine signaling. The brain adapts to the increase in dopamine by increasing the amount of dopamine receptors. As these systems become accustomed, larger quantities of alcohol are required to achieve the increases in dopamine levels and the euphoria associated with them.

At STANMECH Technologies we get many requests for drying solutions. Often the customer immediately asks for a heat solution for drying.

In this article we will explore why hot air is not always the best drying solution and talk about using fast moving air as an alternative to heat.

Why, if the air temperature inside my house is the same on both days, do I feel colder today? We are used to thinking about how warm we feel indoors purely in terms of air temperature – it is, after all, the only thing displayed on the thermostat. Yet whether we feel too cold, too hot, or just right, our thermal comfort, is dependent on much more than just the temperature of the air around us. Models of thermal comfort are pretty well developed\n[4] at a speed that would take it millions of years to do what water can do in a moment. Water feels colder than air, even when at the same temperature Ever been surprised when, on a hot day, you jump into what should be a warm swimming pool and it’s actually freezing? There’s a scientific reason for this. Water, even when it is exactly the same temperature as air, will always feel colder. This is because water is seriously better at conducting heat than air, which really is a thermal insulator (that’s why we usually have a gap of air\n[5] So, where does the sun come in? Thanks to the round shape of the earth and the very different substances covering it (plains, mountains, trees, deserts, beaches, shallow water, deep water, etc), the earth is heated unevenly by the sun. Some areas get hotter than others. And just like we all learned in school, when air gets hot, it expands and decreases in pressure. What happens to this hot air? It rises, creating a vacuum that is filled by – can you guess? – colder, more dense air. And that, right there, is wind. It’s simply colder (i.e. more dense)\n[6] it's hot, the heat doesn't seem to ever lift off and give us some relief. And, when it's cold, the air seeps into our clothes and homes and we feel it to our bones.

Hot air has faster atoms in it than cold air, moving about more rapidly, so they become more spread out, and take up more room. For any given volume, hot air has fewer molecules than cold air. That volume of hot air, having fewer molecules in it, weighs less than the cold air and floats up through it. We say that hot air is less dense than cold air.

When a given room is too dry, humidifiers can add necessary moisture into the air. Humidifiers are typically used during the colder months of the season.

Despite conclusive studies showing little or no association between the two, rumors and myths have persisted. Most coffee brands available on grocery shelves contain caffeine.

Nordheimer Nur: \"The trendy shaven head makes the natural balding a kind of secret, as though people don't know that part of the baldness is natural.

A string of cloudy days could mean less sunlight converted. Also, the changing climate could render some areas unable to produce certain types of renewable energy over time. Production rate: Unlike fossil fuels, renewable energy takes longer to produce energy. This means we either need to consume less energy or find a way to produce energy quicker. Limited: The use of renewable energy is limited by area and resource. For example, the winds of West Texas cannot be found in the same abundance in California. This means our energy production via renewable resources will rely\n[9] List of Pros and Cons of Solar Panels Everywhere around us we are surrounded by an environment that seeks to find renewable sources of energy.

Cows, pigs and chickens supply us with many of our favorite dishes, especially in the United States where we hold the title for the third highest meat consuming country in the world, recorded by the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations in 2009. In 2008, the average American’s yearly meat consumption was as follows: 84.9 lbs. of chicken, 63.5 lbs. of beef, 48.2 of pork and 17.5 lbs. of turkey. Moreover, it is estimated that the\n[2] biggest meat industries, slaughters a combined total of about 41 million cows, chickens, and pigs a week. At that rate, in only eight weeks, Tyson alone would kill off more animals than the entire U.S. population. Animal abuse is normally frowned upon in society. When someone imagines a puppy being beaten by its owner and crying in pain, one’s eyes would usually begin to swell up in tears. However, why isn’t the same sympathy expressed… Meat Diet Essay growing population of the world. A regular meat diet of human mostly consists of beef, pork, lamb and chicken. Meat is recognised\n[3] Sources of meat Of the many foods obtained from the land, humans tend to prefer animal foods, mainly beef, pork, poultry and mutton as well as their by-products e.g. cheeses, milk and eggs. With the exception of pigs, meat may be obtained from animals specifically raised for meat production, or from animals surplus to other requirements. Thus beef may be obtained either from specially raise animals, male and other surplus calves or cows at the end of their milk-producing career. The most important sources of meat in the United States is cattle. Horses have not been an important source of\n[4] heck of a lot of stuff in Norman French.) This bilingualism resulted in some strange dichotomies at the time, and many that still linger today. For example, we wouldn’t say that we want to serve “cow” or “pig” for dinner. We would say “beef” or “pork.” As it turns out, “cow” and “pig” are the Anglo-Saxon (common and conquered) words, and “beef” (boeuf) and “pork” (porc) are the Norman (aristocratic and conquering) words. Some store owners have taken it a step farther by marketing goat meat as “chevron” (from the French chevre). It’s not only nouns that show this tendency.\n[5] cause it’s popular, whereas on a per calorie basis dairy might be 4 times better than cow meat). Sinning is not an all or nothing thing – the degree to which cow meat is worse than pig meat is worse than chickens (etc) needs harping on.

Or why you feel a sense of outrage over whaling, but have few qualms over consuming fish and chips? Why do we eat bacon and pork but not pig, and beef or lamb instead of cows or sheep? What’s really wrong with a bit of horse meat in your casserole anyway? As a psychologist I find that people are mostly inconsistent in their attitudes and beliefs about animals, and especially those\n[7] animals take an exceptional amount of time, feed, and resources to produce a final product that is ready for consumers. Chickens take up less space, can quickly make it to maturity, and turn out substantially less greenhouse gases than either cows or pigs. According to The New York Times, “Pigs and chickens, which convert grain to meat far more efficiently than beef, are increasingly the meats of choice for producers, accounting for 70 percent of total meat production.” With the increase in chicken and pork production, processors have to keep up. Chicken processing is more intensive than it was even\n[8] flesh of the main meat animals are another device whereby we reduce the unpleasant impact of having to acknowledge their identity.

The words sheep, cow, and pig all have clear Old English ancestors (sceap, cu, and picg) and so their names clearly come from Germanic roots.

There are several simple lifestyle changes that can be implanted into your life and sleep routine\n[3] a basic taste because this sensation does not arise from taste buds. Capsaicin is the active ingredient in spicy food and causes “hotness” or “spiciness” when eaten. It stimulates temperature fibers and also nociceptors (pain) in the tongue. In the nociceptors it stimulates the release of substance P, which causes vasodilatation and release of histamine causing hiperalgesia (increased sensitivity to pain).

G) HOT SPICY FOOD. By “hot” I mean both temperature and more spiciness. Spice is not a flavor. It’s actually pain. And heat is also pain. The reason people like hot, spicy foods? Is because the pain triggers that runner’s high, which releases the endorphins. I don’t know what the evolutionary reason for this is.

A little bit of spicy food per day can keep you happy and if\n[6] so-called VR1 pain receptors come into play. Yes, you understood correctly, a genuine form of pain is triggered by capsaicin, the molecule that makes food “hot”: this is the same pain we experience when we put our hand close to fire, with the sole difference that the sensation of pungency is restricted to microscopic areas and does no real harm. Moreover, capsaicin “deceives” our receptors, making them believe there is a temperature of over 43 °C inside the mouth: a kind of innocuous fire alarm that creates a pleasurable sensation on the palate. Many scientists have asked themselves why people\n[7] > Why is chilli hot even if it's cold? The burning sensation when eating something spicy is one that we can all relate to, but why does it burn even when the food has cooled down? The chemical that is responsible for the burning is called capsaicin, which is present in the see-baring tissue in chillis. Capsaicin is an irritant for all mammals where it binds to the TRPV1 receptors on mucus membrane tissue, such as your tongue. TRPV1 are receptors that are responsible for detection of body temperature and will initiate a sensation of heat and pain when triggered.\n[8] an attempt to create the spiciest fruit in the world, and Walton felt he had to keep up by sampling them. Each new variety “was a further assault on the senses,” he says. “If I eat something that’s very hot, then I start hiccuping, my digestive system gets subverted. And very, very occasionally, it can make me feel quite nauseous.” But even though hot chilies trigger temporary discomfort, Walton’s loyalty to the fruit has only intensified.

Stopping a motorcycle is more complex than stopping a car. Motorcycles have separate brakes for the front and rear wheels, and braking hard can lock the wheels and cause the bike to overturn. Not braking hard enough can put the rider into harm’s way. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) said in March 2010 that motorcycles with antilocks versus those without are 37% less likely to be in fatal crashes. As recently as march 2010, the IIHS’s affiliate, the Highway Loss Data Institute (HLDI), found that bikes with antilocks have 22% fewer\n[2] as the rear discs and pads mainly suffer from corrosion. The front wheels do most of the work in a car when the driver tries to bring the vehicle to a halt because when the car decelerates the load is transferred to the front wheels. This explains why you usually need to replace the front discs and pads more often than the rear ones. The braking system uses friction to stop the vehicle, with hydraulic pressure often being used in braking systems. This pressure pushes the brake pads against the brake disc inside a cast iron drum to bring the\n[3] side of the caliper to check pad thickness. If the wheel design won’t allow this, we have to jack up the car and take one of the wheels off. Generally, the front brake pads wear faster than the rears, so check them first. During braking, the front brake pads generally do more of the work in slowing down the car. This is because the bulk of the car’s weight transfers to the front axle under braking. So, it’s best to jack the car up at the front, take off one of the front wheels, and check the brake pads up\n[4] is the front swaybar- a big front sway will cause understeer with jerky inputs, as the weight transfers quickly and overloads the tire, but once the wheel is weighted, the bar keeps the wheel in the sweet spot of its travel. Stock cars are designed with about 10% more braking to the front than rear, regardless of a sporting intent. Once the car is spinning under braking, the effectiveness of the brakes is significantly reduced. You want a car that understeers under braking. A car with sport tires and/or properly damped suspension is going to be able to stop better,\n[5] with long winters, any reputable bike shop will sell studded tires. Braking[edit] As a moving vehicle brakes, the vehicle applies a forward force on the road, and the road applies an equal and opposite backward force on the wheel. When braking a bike at maximum deceleration, all the force is transferred to the front wheel, and the rear wheel is on the point of lifting. It follows from this that the front brake provides more braking force than the rear. Many riders are reluctant to use the front brake fully for fear of going over the handlebars, and some old-fashioned\n[6] happening. Depending on what the bike rider saw, he may have reasonably interpreted the signs and signals to mean that this car was about to pull in front of him. I’m pretty sure, however, that this was not going to happen. The bike rider slammed on his brakes, but it seems that the front brake stuck more firmly than the back brake. The bike stopped instantly and the rear tire started to swing around to the right. But that was irrelevant now, because the bike rider, who was already leaning forward on the handle bars as per normal, was in\n[7] recommended that the front brakes are always used. The use of rear brakes in slippery conditions is for the same reason that cars have anti-lock brakes on their front wheels; since the front wheels are used for steering, then the rider/driver is unable to steer when these wheels lock up. Thus, it is recommended to only use the rear brakes when possible, in case the bike starts to slip and a course adjustment is necessary. Lastly, studded tires are a wise investment in climates with prolonged slippery conditions. These tires add much-needed traction to the bike itself. In most locations\n[8] On stock bikes entering Australia, this comes from the following Australian Standards clause: Australian Standard AS1927 – 1998 Pedal Bicycles – Safety Requirements, page 16 Section 2.14 Braking System 2.14.2.1 states the following: Handbrake lever location: The brake lever for a front brake shall be positioned on the right-hand side of the handlebar, and that for a rear brake on the left-hand side. In North America and many parts of Europe this is the opposite. You ride on the right side of the road and your front brake is on the left-hand side, the rear brake is on the right-hand\n[9] to ride a bike, since it's simpler. The front brakes are better at stopping a bike but can cause a crash or an accident if not done properly. That's why it's important to practice with the rear brakes first to get comfortable and then practice with the front brakes. This way you become comfortable with both the front and rear brakes. If your bike had no brakes in the handle bars, it mostly likely has back pedal brakes. In order to use back pedal brakes you need to apply pressure to the pedals and keep each pedal close to the\n[10] Leader in Brake System Manufacturing SBS is the world's leading manufacturers of brake pads for motorcycles and motocross bikes.

Why not just \"frontal\" cortex?\n\nDocuments:\n[1] The prefrontal cortex is located at the very front of the frontal lobes. Scientists believe this area of the brain plays a role in the regulation of emotions. Brain imaging techniques show that people who are depressed demonstrate decreased activity in the prefrontal cortex. Additionally, the ventromedial cortex is a part of the prefrontal cortex that is associated with decision making and mood changes. This area of the brain is typically much smaller in people with depression. Biology and Depression Clearly, the relationship between depression and brain activity is far more complex than was once thought. Researchers are continually uncovering\n[2] human brain region with the organisation of the monkey prefrontal cortex. Overall, they were very similar with 11 of the 12 areas being found in both species and being connected up to other brain areas in very similar ways. However, one area of the human ventrolateral frontal cortex had no equivalent in the macaque – an area called the lateral frontal pole prefrontal cortex. 'We have established an area in human frontal cortex which does not seem to have an equivalent in the monkey at all,' says first author Franz-Xaver Neubert of Oxford University. 'This area has been identified with\n[3] divides into specialized sections: such as the cerebral cortex, the frontal cortex, and the prefrontal cortex. The brain develops in structure (regions of the brain consisting of clusters of brain cells called neurons) and function (activities of the brain, such as sending electronic signals or hormone production and secretion). Structures important to early development and learning include neurons, the cerebral cortex, prefrontal cortex, and the amygdala. Functions include synaptogenesis, myelination, and cortisol production of the HPA (hypothalamic- pituitary-adrenal) system. These structures and functions demonstrate some ways the brain develops in early childhood, and are detailed below. Neurons are the basic\n[4] happens when attention gels and neurons increasingly fire in sync with one another. There is less chaos, more focus. Prefrontal cortex: the front portion of the frontal lobe, this area is especially strengthened by meditation. It is involved with positive mood, concentration, creativity, rational thinking, planning, motivation, abstract reasoning, values, self-monitoring, and impulse control. Between the frontal and prefrontal cortices, we can understand why so many cognitive processes improve with meditation.

The prefrontal cortex houses the decision-making portion of the brain, which is negatively impacted when large amounts of alcohol are consumed. For adolescents, the prefrontal cortex is still developing, which naturally causes lapses in judgment. When combined with alcohol, the short-term impact can be deadly. This is one reason behind the legal driving age becoming 21. During the teen years, the brain is also undergoes restructuring that involves the elimination of what it deems as unnecessary neural connections between the frontal-subcortical brain regions. Neural activity in the prefrontal cortex – or lack thereof – has been linked to\n[6] diseases for example, Parkinson's disease and Schizophrenia. The prefrontal cortex is one of the last regions of the brain to develop therefore its functions and disorders remain being researched. The prefrontal lobe is connected to the anterior region of the frontal lobe. The prefrontal lobe size increases slowly before era of eight, then a prefrontal growth spurt increases in between the age groups of eight and fourteen years. In contrast with other brain areas the prefrontal cortex is one of the previous region to development therefore the functions and disorders aren't immediately obvious (Kanemura 195). As studied in an experiment\n[7] think—if you could not detect things that are harmful or stressful, you would not survive! The amygdala shares a special connection with another part of the brain called the prefrontal cortex. The prefrontal cortex is a big region in the front of the brain (Figure 1). It can be called the control center of our brains because it helps to control our thoughts and actions. The main job of the prefrontal cortex is to control our emotional responses to stress so that we do not get too stressed out. This is why the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex share a\n[8] Stephen Hawking. The prefrontal cortex region of the brain is highlighted in red. So what would happen if you remove only the prefrontal cortex, instead of the entire frontal lobe? Well, a person without a prefrontal cortex would be unable to plan their actions, to inhibiting inappropriate behaviors & emotions, to verbally express oneself, and would have specific memory processing deficits. First, it is observed that people with frontal lobe damage aren’t able to give appropriate emotional responses. For example, if a person is happy, he can’t express that happiness. It is also observed that frontal lobe damage may cause\n[9] There are many brain regions that are involved in memory recognition and retrieval. The sensory cortex is located in the rear of the brain in the posterior cortex. The prefrontal regions or anterior cortex are in the front. Lateral prefrontal regions (lPFC), those structures that run along the perimeter of the prefrontal cortex, are involved in anticipation, preparatory cognition, response inhibition, and cognitive processing. The anterior prefrontal cortex or frontal pole is specialized for long term memory retrieval. The areas of the cortex that are closest to the front (anterior) top (dorsal) surface but deep in the middle or medial\n[10] make the human body feel at ease. This explains why whether it be a dip of the toes or a swim, we feel relaxed; like an immediate weight has been lifted off our shoulders. All of these factors help us to unwind and feel a sense of security; allowing room for us to let go of our worries and stress. The reason we are able to feel that way is because it affects our prefrontal cortex, which is the front part of our brain.

Making sure that your Services hit the mark is the difficult bit. However many neuromarketing experts claim to be able to help you do just that using fMRI. So what is it all about? Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a neuroimaging technique that uses MRI technology to measure brain activity by detecting changes in blood flow. Neuromarketers claim that fMRI can show how someone feels when your Service, or how hard someone finds a task.

In this course, students will learn about the essential facts of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). FMRI presents clear advantages over the other methods, particularly in terms of increased spatial resolution. Since its invention in 1992, fMRI has led to major advances in understanding the neural mechanisms that underlie higher levels of human mental activity and has established a strong\n[7] Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), Near Infra-Red Spectroscopy (NIRS), Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).

How do we test whether ‘potential information’ in fMRI (experimenter-as-receiver) is ‘actual information’ (cortex-as-receiver)? In the previous section, we have highlighted that successful decoding reveals potential information, but that we need to go further to test whether different patterns of activity\n[9] thank you for clearly deconstructing their pseudoscience. lisa v January 10, 2017 at 2:42 pm psychiatry is not a pseudoscience and I disagree with this article. they now have fMRI scans and other scans that show abnormalities in the brain with disorders and these are real because these are new and very accurate types of scanning and I have an illness that I know for sure is real by my own experience. scans don’t diagnose disorders but these fMRIs can show certain abnormalities of brain function and there are certain characteristics with each different illness. oldhead January 10, 2017 at\n[10] tube during the scan.

Instead, once a player is tackled, the player must roll the ball back with his feet and a “Chicken Scratch” occurs where a player from each side competes for the ball differently to how they would in Rugby Union. If the ball is kicked off the field in Rugby League, a scrum will occur where 8 players will pack down to essentially give the backs more space to run into. In Rugby Union, however, if the ball is kicked off the field, a lineout takes\n[8] this post, we explore the key things you should know about rugby and the upcoming national and international rugby events. What you should know about rugby Though the sport as a whole is known as rugby, there are actually two types of rugby – rugby union and rugby league. Rugby union is played with 15 per side and only seven substitutions are allowed. On the other hand, rugby league allows only 13 players per team, but each side can make ten substitutions. Rugby union and rugby league also differ in scoring systems: Tries: Union – 5 points; League – 4\n[9] lot of rules around what players can do in this part of the game. In Rugby League, they just have a ‘play the ball’ where, once a player is tackled, they get up and roll the ball through their legs with their foot and the other team can’t try to steal it like in Rugby Union. 5. Rugby Union has contested scrums (players actually push against the other team’s scrum to try to gain possession of the ball). Scrums happen to restart the game after a minor infringement of the rules. 6.

You really must disabuse yourself of this idea. Lunch counters and buses were crucial symbolic planes of struggle that the civil rights movement used to dramatize the issue, but the main suffering in the south did not come from our inability to drink from the same fountain, ride in the front of the bus or eat lunch at Woolworth’s.
